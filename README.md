# MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING

This is a repository that documents everything I learn on the topic. It aims to be a one stop place where I host everything I learn and the resources that I have used to learn them. This repository aims to be a comprehensive reference point as well. It contains both practical (coding) as well as theory.

The [Learn ML Folder](/LEARN-ML) contains obsidian notes that I have created on topics that I come across and that are related. Most of these notes are made while watching lecture videos or youtube videos.

This is always going to be a work-in-progress as it is something I will update as I learn new things, and improve old notes based on better understanding I achieve late down the road. I hope by documenting my own journey and struggles I can help future readers and learners.
